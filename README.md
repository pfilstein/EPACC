East Point Angular Code Challenge
=====================

This is the repository for East Point Systems Angular coding challenge.

## Setup

1. First fork this repository to your github account and clone it locally.
2. Create a new feature branch for your work.
3. Install Node.js if it's not already installed (any version > 6 should work).
4. Run `npm install` to retrieve dependencies.
5. To start the project run `npm start`.

## Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build an application that can search for and display github repositories.  Github's API documentation is hosted [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

The application needs to do three things:
* Allow a user to enter a search term.
* Display github repositories matching that term.
* Allow a user to view the details of the repository (Name, Description, Url, last five commits, etc)

Feel free to modify any of the existing code or add any additional libraries in order to complete the challenge.

When you're finished submit a pull request to the East Point fork for review.

## Notes
 * Tests can be run with `npm test` or `npm e2e` for the end to end tests.
 * This repository is built using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
